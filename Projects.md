## Programming for Social Scientists Portfolio

This portfolio contains the work conducted in order to complete the first assignment for the Programming for Social Scientists module conducted at the University of Leeds. The aim of the assignment is to build an Agent Based Model and display the output on a website, as well as linking the code to the model.
