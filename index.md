## Research Projects

**Undergraduate Dissertation**

In the final year of my Undergraduate Degree in BSc Geography, I undertook a dissertation project that aimed to investigate the controls on marine ice sheet instability in the Arctic. My dissertation involved the use of MATLAB and GIS software.

**Postgraduate research**

My PhD research project aims to bridge the gap between large scale Census data and smaller scale community and household data through new data fusion techniques. Throughout my research, I aim to:
* Learn programming languagues, including Python and R.
* Understanding survey data and how to analyse it.
* Developing new techniques for data fusion and synthetic estimation
